          <h3>Sea Life</h3>
          
          <p>Sea life is the amazing diversity of living things in the oceans and other saltwater environments. Sea life produces oxygen, absorbs carbon dioxide, and supports the food web. Sea life also provides many benefits for humans, such as food, medicine, recreation, and inspiration. However, sea life faces many threats, such as pollution, overfishing, climate change, and habitat loss. We can help protect sea life by reducing our impact on the environment, supporting conservation efforts, and learning more about the wonders of the ocean.

        <h3>Coral Reefs</h3>
        
        <p>Coral reefs are alive and full of amazing creatures. They are like underwater cities that provide food, protection, and tourism for millions of people. Coral reefs are very old and very valuable, but they need our help to survive. Pollution, climate change, and overfishing are some of the threats that coral reefs face. We can help save coral reefs by using less water, not touching them when we visit, and spreading the word about how awesome they are!

        <p>Fishing is a popular activity that involves catching fish from different water sources, such as lakes, rivers, or oceans. Fishing can be done for food, sport, or fun.
